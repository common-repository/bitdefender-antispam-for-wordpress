BitDefender 4 Blogs is one of our newest solutions to fight spam... on blogs.

== Description ==

You probably already know that 9 out of 10 email messages are spam, but did you know that almost 8 out of 10 blog comments are spam? At this very moment, there is no spam free communication platform, and every day we see how spammers and malware writers expand their territories and conquer new communication environments.
 
This is why we, at BitDefender, are doing extensive research on comment related spam and we're glad to offer this solution to the bloggers. It's fresh out of a fairly extensive closed beta where it ran, collected, analyzed and filtered a huge amount of comments on a few hundred selected blogs and we got the engines to a really competitive level, ready for you to test and use.
 
We donâ€™t believe we are perfect, but we are, however, tweaking the engines and tuning our technology with every feedback we receive. 
 
As of Dec 2nd, BitDefender 4blogs is officially in public BETA and you can install it with a few clicks either by downloading the plug-in from our website or through the WP plug-ins repository. We appreciate all feedback so don't hesitate to get in touch with us.
 
For further information about the technology, you can either check our website at http://4blogs.bitdefender.com or directly email us at 4blogs@bitdefender.com.
